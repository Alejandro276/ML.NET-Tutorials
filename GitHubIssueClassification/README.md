# Tutorial: Categorize support issues using multiclass classification with ML.NET

This site was built using [ML.NET guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/github-issue-classification)

This sample tutorial illustrates using ML.NET to create a GitHub issue classifier to train a model that classifies and predicts the Area label for a GitHub issue via a .NET Core console application using C# in Visual Studio.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

* Prepare your data
* Transform the data
* Train the model
* Evaluate the model
* Predict with the trained model
* Deploy and Predict with a loaded model
